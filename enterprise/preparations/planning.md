title: Planning your IPv6 project
---

Everyone that has done an IPv6 implementation will confirm: Planning your IPv6 project is extremely important.
Proper planning reduces the cost and risks of any project and this is not different for IPv6.
If you were assigned the task of IPv6 project manager, the first things you would need to know are:
- objectives (What is your goal? Implement IPv6)
- scope (for which services do you want to implement IPv6? Or for which locations?)
- timeline (When do you want IPv6 on certain locations or services?)
- stakeholders (Who are dependent on this project? Who are the people I have to report to?)
- high-level requirements (What does for example the IT department need from me to work on this project?)
- assumptions (for example an IPv4 run-out plan, how many IPv4 addresses do you currently have) 
- resources and other interesting facts about the project.
