title: Project manager
---

Appointing an IPv6 project manager in a company that wants to implement IPv6
is crucial, as otherwise just lots of talking is usually involved and no
real work is done.  If you appoint an IPv6 project manager make sure you
assign him a task to create an implementation plan with clear milestones and
delivery dates and also the means to execute it.

Such a project manager's responsibilities should become less over time. 
IPv6 should not be one person's responsibility but something that becomes a
normal part of the company's workflows.  Introducing IPv6 in the enterprise
is a project.  Once it is introduced it must not be considered "special"
anymore.
