title: Pros and cons of different address types
---
We have discussed different ways of getting IPv6 addresses to use in your
deployment: [from your ISP](use_PA), [provider independent](use_PI) or
[becoming an ISP for your own organisation](use_LIR). Here we put those
different options side by side and discuss why you would choose one or the
other.

The first thing to realise is that technically all these addresses are
equal. An address is just a number to use as source and destination in an
IP packet. The differences discussed here are only related to who is
responsible for addresses. These different responsibilities can affect
the way you use addresses, whether you are allowed to keep using addresses
after your contracts with ISPs change and whether it is possible to share
responsibility for routing between multiple ISPs. But in the end they are
all just numbers and one type of addresses is not better than another.
