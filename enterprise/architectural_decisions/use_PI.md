title: Provider Independent Addresses
---

There are many enterprises that only have one or a few locations and a small network. 
Also, you might not have a network specialist that is familiar with requesting and administrating 
IP addresses from a Regional Internet Registry, like [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/) or [ARIN](https://www.arin.net/). 
In that case, you can consider to request Provider Independent IPv6 addressess.
The minimum size of a PI block is a /48 and more can be requested, but then you have to justify why you would need more than a /48.

If you are located in the RIPE service region (Europe, Middle East and parts of Central Asia), you have to find a [member](https://www.ripe.net/participate/member-support/info/list-of-members)
of RIPE NCC that is willing to request the IPv6 addresses on your behalf. This is called a "[Sponsoring LIR](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/faq/independent-resources/phase-three/what-is-a-sponsoring-lir)" and they take care
of the request and often the RIPE Database. 

Your Provider Independent address block will be assigned to your enterprise, so in the end you are responsible for your IPv6 addresses.
