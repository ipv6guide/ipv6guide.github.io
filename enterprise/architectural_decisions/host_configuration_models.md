Remember when IPv6 was invented, DHCP (v4) didn't exist. They included in the IPv6, a mechanism we call SLAAC. The idea was that MAC address would used as interface identifier, but MAC address is only 48 bits. Needed to pad out to 64-bits, so added fffe. 
Make the point that the interface identifier is 64 bits. Add link to 'What was the reason for 64 bits as interface identifier in the first place' [link to addressing bit]
