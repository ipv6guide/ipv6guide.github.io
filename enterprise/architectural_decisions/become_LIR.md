Becoming an LIR
---

In some cases, the only way to get IPv6 addresses is to become a member of a Regional Internet Registry (RIR).
For example if you want to connect your customers over IPv6 or if you don't want to rely on anyone else for your IPv6
addresses. In the RIPE region, anyone can [become a member of RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/participate/member-support/become-a-member). From very small enterprises to very large telecom operators. 
After you have signed up, you can request your IP addresses and also, if you need one, an Autonomous System number. 

The smallest allocation size is usually a /32, but in the RIPE region you can get up to a /29 allocation without any extra justification.
In case your enterprise needs more IPv6 addresses than a /29, you have to show an addressing plan that can justify your larger request.
Remember, a /29 is 512k /48s, that is a lot of IPv6 address space.

In any case, it is always recommended to write your addressing plan before requesting your IPv6 addresses, to avoid renumbering projects later on.

Summary
-------

- Becoming a member of an RIR is a good idea when:
  - You want to connect customers
  - You want to get a large block of addresses
- Becoming a member of an RIR might *not* be a good idea when:
  - You only need a small block of IPv6
  - You only want to use IPv6 for your own infrastructure
