Talk to your uplink ISP(s) about IPv6 availability
==================================================
The enterprise IPv6 connectivity requirements include:

- IPv4 / IPv6 Dual Stack connections (data communication) across the
  contracted circuit
- IPv4 / IPv6 Service level Agreements (SLA’s) equal to existing contracted
  SLA’s for the contracted circuit
- IPv4 / IPv6 circuit bandwidth, latency, packet loss, packet reordering and
  jitter specifications equal to existing contracted circuit
- IPv6 routing of the enterprise's address space equal to existing routing
  across the contracted circuit

We provide example checklists for 
[circuits](circuit_checklist),
[routing prefixes](routing_checklist)
and
[services](services_checklist).
