title: Circuit checklist
---

* Are all components of the circuit IPv6 enabled?  Yes / No (Mandatory
  response required)
    * If yes, does the circuit support dual stacks operation of IPv6 and
      IPv4?  (Yes / No)
    * If no, please list components of circuit with the following
      conditions:
        * List of circuit components that are not IPv6 enabled, but are IPv6
          ready.  Please include road map with dates when components will be
          IPv6 enabled.
        * List of circuit components that are not IPv6 enabled, and are not
          IPv6 ready.  Please include plan with dates when these components
          will be IPv6 ready and when they will be IPv6 enabled.
* Can the circuit that services the existing IPv4 connection be converted to
  dual-stack without the physical changes ?
* If the your IPv6 ready or IPv6 enabled circuits will have different
  Service Levels as compared to a IPv4 only circuit, please provide more
  details.
* Please provide details if your IPv6 ready or IPv6 enabled circuits will
  not be able to route Provider Independent address space that is equal to
  existing routing across the contracted circuit.
* Can IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity be delivered to a customer via a 802.1q
  tagged interface, with a separate VLAN for IPv4 and IPv6 communications?
* If you use VRFs to provide a service, is the IPv4 and IPv6 using the
  same VRF or different ones?
