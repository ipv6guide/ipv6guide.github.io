Look at IPv6 myths on Deploy360 blog
Reference them

Compare v4 to equivalent in v6
Tony Hain - briefings

IPv6 makes some things better, other things worse and most things are just different, but no more or less secure
Better
  Automated scanning and worm propagation is harder due to huge subnets
  Link-local addresing can limit infrastructure attacks
  IPsec will be routinely available for use where keys exist
Worse
  Lack of familiarity with IPv6 among operators.
  Multiple addresses per interface is a different concpt
  Immaturity of software in the next few years
  Improperly deployed transition techniques
