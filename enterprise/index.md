title: IPv6 for Enterprises
---

Introduction
============
IPv6 has already been deployed in many places.  Most (if not all) big
transit providers have IPv6, more and more ISPs are offering IPv6 to their
users, and major content providers like
[Google](https://www.google.com/ipv6) and
[Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1192894270727351/ipv6-it-s-time-to-get-on-board/)
are reachable over IPv6.  One group of network operators that seems to stay
behind a bit is enterprises.  Many enterprises seem to think that they don't
need IPv6, or when they do they don't know where to start.  This is why this
section on [IPv6 Guide](https://ipv6guide.net/) was created: to help
enterprises understand which role they play in the global internet and help
them to deploy IPv6 with as little effort as possible.

Phases
======
We recommend to split an project to implement IPv6 into at least these three stages:

- [Preparation](preparations)
- [Architectural decisions](architectural_decisions)
- [Implementation](implementation)
