Focus areas
===========
For some environments we are building a whole set of documentation to help
you get started.  For now we have only one such section for enterprises. 
More contributions would be more than welcome!

- [Enterprise](enterprise)

Sources of information
======================
There is a lot of information already out there.  Where possible we prefer
links to existing high-quality documentation instead of new text. 
Especially if there is good documentation from well known sources such as
[ISOC Deploy360](http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/), the
[RIPE community](https://www.ripe.net/participate/ripe),
[NANOG](https://www.nanog.org) etc.  When multiple good sources exist they
should all be referred to.
